    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p>Copyright Â©2002 by David Matuszek</p>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
    <p>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if you didn't, it isn't.<br><br>

        Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the root, you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf. <br><br>
        
        Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice, and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.
        
        <br><br> 
        <p>This needs an example.</p>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>starting at Root , your options are A and B. you choose A.</li>
            <li> At A your options are C and D. you choose C</li>
            <li> C is bad. go back to A.</li>
            <li> At A you have already tried C, and it failed. try D</li>
            <li> At Root you have already A, try B </li>
            <li> So, at B your options are E and F,try E.</li>
            <li>E is good. congratulations</li>
        </ol>
        
            <p>A parent-child hierarchy is a hierarchy with multiple levels that track the relationships within the hierarchy. For example, in a hierarchy that represents an
                organizational structure, you can have two levels: Manager and Employee. <i>Manager level is the parent level,and the</i> Employee level is the child level.</p>
                
            <h2>The backtracking algorithm.</h2>
            <p>Here is the algorithm (in pseudocode) for doing backtracking from a given node n:</p>
            <pre>
            <p class="algorithm">boolean solve(Node n) {
                if n is a leaf node {
                    if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                    else return false
                } else {
                    for each child c of n {
                        if solve(c) succeeds, return true
                    }
                    return false
                }
            }</p>
            </pre>
            <p>Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a<i>boolean function.</i>  This is essential to understanding the algorithm. solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a path from the root to some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.</p>
            <p>How does this work?</p>

            <ul>
               <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li> 
                <li>if no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code, this is done by the lines</p>
            <pre>
            <p class="algorithm">
                for each child c of n {
                    if solve(c) succeeds, return true
                }
                return false
             </p>
            </pre>

         <h4>Keeping backtracking simple</h4>
         <p>All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex: for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate solutions.

            To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for example, you could test whether a node is a leaf by writing a gameOver method (or you could even call it isLeaf). This method would encapsulate all the ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain.
            
            Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its children have been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look simple, by just saying for each child c of n. In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through them. In chess, for example, a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track of which ones you've already examined?</p>
            <p>And we get these results:</p>

        <h3>Example: Cindy's Puzzle</h3>
        <p>I call the following puzzle "Cindy's puzzle" for historical reasons. You have some number n of black marbles and the same number of white marbles, and you have a playing board which consists simply of a line of 2n+1 spaces to put the marbles in. Start with the black marbles all at one end (say, the left), the white marbles all at the other end, and a free space in between.</p>

            <p>The black marbles can only move to the right, and the white marbles can only move to the left (no backing up). At each move, a marble can either:</p>
            <ul type="bullet">
                <li>Move one space ahead, if that space is clear, or</li>
                <li>Jump ahead over exactly one marble of the opposite color, if the space just beyond that marble is clear.</li>
